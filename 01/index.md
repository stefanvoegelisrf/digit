## Digital, digitalization and digitality

### What does the term "digital" mean?

Digital is a term to describe when something is brought into a form that machines/computers can understand it. E.g. when we see the color red, computers don't know how to handle red as they do not work like we as humans do. The value has to be broken down into different parts so that when we want to display red, the computer needs to know what values to pass to a monitor so it can be correctly displayed.

### What does the term "digitalzation" mean?

Digitalization is the process of taking processes that are made by hand or mechanical and put them into a form, that involves the use of digital systems. E.g. banking has been done analog. Meaning, money has been kept at a bank and we had to go to a front desk to get/put money. To "digitalize" banking, we have an account at a bank, but the money is mostly not physically present. The money can be easily transfered to an account by e.g. using e-banking.
