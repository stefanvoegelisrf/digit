## Economic laws

| Econimic principle        | Definition                                                                                                                                                           |

| Non-rivalising            | Digital goods are non-rivalising because they can be losslessly duplicated                                                                                           |
| Absence of marginal costs | Digital goods and services have high initial cost(high fix cost), but further copies have almost no cost(=marginal cost)                                             |
| Arthurs law               | Sinking to inexisten marginal cost as well as network effects lead to monopolies, as leading system profit form these laws                                           |
| Scaling                   | A digital service has to scale economically as well as technically, meaning that it can exponentially grow                                                           |
| Long-tail effect          | If storage costs do not play a role, most of the turnover can be generated with niche products, in digital space almost every viewpoint will find like-minded people |

### Non-rivalising

Digital goods are in its nature non-rivalising. Rivalising goods, for example food, are rivalising because when you eat it, no other person can it eat. For non-rivalising goods, a perfeclty functional copy can be created, without losing anything. The more copies exist, the more meaningful the good gets.

###Â Absence of marginal cost

The production of the first speciman of e.g. a digital Book is high. The cost of reproduction is nearly free. This applies to digital goods as well as to familiarization of a new system. Entry cost is high, but every additional part is massively more cost attractive. This applies for example for
