## Economic laws of the digital world
| Econimic principle        | Definition                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Non-rivalising            | Digital goods are non-rivalising because they can be losslessly duplicated                                                                                           |
| Absence of marginal costs | Digital goods and services have high initial cost(high fix cost), but further copies have almost no cost(=marginal cost)                                             |
| Arthurs law               | Sinking to inexistent marginal cost as well as network effects lead to monopolies, as leading system profit form these laws                                           |
| Scaling                   | A digital service has to scale economically as well as technically, meaning that it can exponentially grow                                                           |
| Long-tail effect          | If storage costs do not play a role, most of the turnover can be generated with niche products, in digital space almost every viewpoint will find like-minded people |

### Non-rivalising
Digital goods are in its nature non-rivalising. Rivalising goods, for example food, are rivalising because when you eat it, no other person can it eat.

For non-rivalising goods, a perfeclty functional copy can be created, without losing anything. The more copies exist, the more meaningful the good gets.

###Â Absence of marginal cost
The production of the first speciman of e.g. a digital Book is high. The cost of reproduction is nearly free. This applies to digital goods as well as to familiarization of a new system. Entry cost is high, but every additional part is massively more cost attractive.

### Arthurs law
If marginal cost in nearly inexistent and network effects apply to a business/company/system, this will lead to monopolies as the leading system will profit from these principles and have a big advantage over small players. Small players have a harder time of gaining attention and are often times required to work together with big players and don't have as much power as big companies.

### Scaling
A digital business has to scale economically and technically so exponential growth is possible. Infrastructure must be able to handle user requests. If a digital service is not scalable, it is hard to justify the development cost. This is due to the fact that economically the idea or service has got to be be profitable.

Jeremy Rifkin makes the distinction between lateral and vertical scaling. An example of lateral scaling is e.g. Fog-Computing, where most processing work is done on hardware in a decentralised way. On the other hand, there is the vertical scaling, e.g. Cloud-Computing where processing work is done in a centralised way.

### Long-tail-effect
Absence of marginal cost and network effects do not only lead to monopolies but also enable the monopolies to also serve niches. This is due to the fact that digital goods don't take up storage space and also don't cost much. By taking advantage of this fact, niche products can also offered. In a global business, the niche products also find their customer and even make up most of the profit. If we compare a physical and a digital book store, we can observe the long-tail-effect. The physical book store has very limited space and therefore can only offer a small range of books that appeal to a broad audience to generate sales. Offering niche products would not generate enough sales. A digital book store does not have the space limitation and therefore can also offer niche products and generate sales from popular as well as niche products.

## Economic rivalising design
There are two types economic rivalising designs: **Locked-in-effect** and **artificial limitation**.

### Locked-in-effect
The locked-in-effect describes the effect that we are locked to a specific system as we already have invested a lot of energy/cost for buying a system and learning to use it. Also if many users have adopted it, the system is crucial and can't be easily replaced.

There are typical practices that businesses apply to create a locked-in-effect:
- Using non-standard methods
- Bundling multiple products/services
- Using artifical limitation

### Artifical limitation
By having digital goods and services that can be duplicated with (almost) no cost, they are often artificially limited so that they can also be re-sold. 

Artifical limitation is created in several ways:
- linking the digtial product to a physical elements, e.g. Amiibos
- creating digital unique pieces
- adding copy protection
- personalization

## Business models
There are different business models in the digital world which are described below.

### Freemium
In the freemium model, the basic usage of a service can be used free of charge. If you exceed the possibilities of the free model, you pay for additional features. By using this model, users are more likely to use the service and therefore it reaches a broader usage. Through the broader usage, a minority of users pay the cost of the service while most users only need the basic services and therefore don't pay. Free + Premium = Freemium

### Free-to-play
The free-to-play model is the freemium model applied to games. Here the users mostly pay for virtual objects like skins or other assets.

For free-to-play models, it is essential that they don't go into a pay-to-win model, as this shrinks the appeal of the game for users that don't pay. Pay-to-win means that you have an advantage if you pay for certain parts in a game.

### Access instead of ownership
This concept describes that it is not meaningful to buy something that you are likely to only use a single time. Rather you pay for a license to use something once and don't own it.

### Flatrate
A flatrate describes the concept of paying once for a service and then you are able to e.g. be able to watch all movies on a platform instead of buying each movie individually. Often times, users pay more in this model compared to when they buy individually. However, the flatrate is more convenient for users since you only have a single payment process compared to buying something every time.

### Platforms
Providing a platform means being a marketplace where others are able to distribute or offer goods/services. App-stores are a prominent examples of a platform.

## Excercise A
Name two examples of digital goods that have been artificially limited by
- Binding it to a physical item
  - Music that can only be listened to if you buy a limited edition box
  - Amiibo(physical product to play a virtual character)
- Creating unique designs
  - limited skins
  - domains
- Applying copy protection
  - Games
  - Watermarking
- Personalization
  - personalized digital goods

## Excercise B
Streaming services are an example of access instead of ownership.
- What series/movies do you watch on which service?
  - YouTube videos, PlaySuisse, PlaySRF, SunriseTV and occasionally buying movies
- How much do you spend for series/movies?
  - Monthly fee for Sunrise and SRG fee
- Are you going to subscribe to more services? How do you access series/movies?
  - No, I won't subsribe to more services. I will pay for movies or series or stream them.
- Which general and economic laws apply for streaming services?
  - Freemium model: Some streaming services can be used for free, but you have to watch ads instead.
  - Absence or marginal cost: Initial cost for a movie is high but distributing it is nearly free
  - Long-tail-effect: Due to having a big platform, niche movies and series can be provided.
  - Scaling: Streaming platforms have to be built in a way that users can stream seamlessly without disruption.
  - Locked-in-effect: Some series/movies are only available on specific platforms
  - Access instead of ownership: On Streaming platforms, you own none of the series/movies.
  - Flatrate: Most streaming services allow you to watch the whole range of series/movies with only paying one fee.
  - Platform: Streaming sites are platforms as they allow distribution of series/movies on their sites.
  - Arthurs law: As there are already big players in the film industry, this will likely apply to the streaming platforms.
- What is your view on how the streaming market will develop?
  - I think this is dependent on regulation in the individual countries. I think the global market, specifically for series/movies, will overshadow local productions in switzerland as they have higher budget than swiss productions, as they already do now. I think this will become even more critical.

## Excercise C
