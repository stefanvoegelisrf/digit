Read chapter 0-2 of Daniel Hillis - The Pattern on the Stone : The Simple Ideas That Make Computers Work

In these chapters, Daniel Hillis provides an overview of boolean logic. He explains **and**, **or** and **not**. He explains how a tic-tac-toe machine can be created using boolean logic. The boolean logic is further explained with examples of rock-paper-scissors or traffic lights.

## Differentiating terms: Tool, machine, automat, computer, roboter

**Tools** are used by hand. If we add a **motor**, we can call it a **machine**. If we **control** the machine **automatically**, we have an **automat**. Automats have a **fixed control structure** which is dependent on the **state** of the automat. The fixed control structure can be shown as a construction diagram.
What differentiates the automat from the computer is that the computer is **programmable**. When adding a **body**, we are talking about a robot. The body is defined by having **sensors** and **actors**. The body does not need to be physical. Through the body, the roboter has **agency** and also some sort of **intelligence**.
