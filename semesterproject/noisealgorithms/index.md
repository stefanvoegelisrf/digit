## Snowflakes sketch

To create the snowflakes, there is a p5js sketch created: [Snowflakes](snowflakes)

The sketch allows for minimal configuration with query params, specifically the noise seed. See some examples here
- [Seed 38](snowflakes/index.html?seed=38)
- [Seed 58](snowflakes/index.html?seed=58)
- [Seed 78](snowflakes/index.html?seed=78)
- [Seed 89](snowflakes/index.html?seed=89)
- [Seed 94](snowflakes/index.html?seed=94)
- [Seed 95](snowflakes/index.html?seed=95)

- [Seed 135](snowflakes/index.html?seed=135)


## Text version 1

It‘s finally winter time. So I made a cute little snow filter. You can use it too and here‘s how I did it. First I used something called an algorithm. I looked at different snowflakes and tried to create a set of instructions to draw it. First draw some lines from the center, then create the details. As you know, every snowflake is different, so it‘s hard to create an algorithm that would produce realistic snowflakes. But algorithms don‘t create reality, they only try to approach it as close as possible. Look how cute it came out. Now let‘s take this image and put it into SparkAR Studio, a tool from Meta(the Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp company). I told the program to give me thousands of them and placed them around me at random positions. Then I made them fall. Notice how they all fall constantly at the same speed. Let‘s use a noise algorithm to change their speed, position and rotation almost randomly. That‘s better, still not real but it creates a beautiful effect. By using a noise algorithm, I can have displacement that is changing over time but not completely random. Here‘s how it would look if it was random. Noise algorithms are also used for many other stuff like creating worlds in Minecraft and other games. There are thousands of algorithms that influence your life. Like the algorithms that help you find the best train connection or if this video will be recommended to you.

Winter wonderland alert! I crafted this adorable snow filter and you're all invited to join the fun! Here’s how I did it: I kicked off with something super cool called an algorithm. I checked out various snowflakes and brainstormed a plan to sketch them out. Kick off with lines shooting out from the center, then get down to the fine details. But hey, every snowflake is its own kind of awesome, so nailing down an algorithm for lifelike snowflakes was kinda tricky. But hey, algorithms aren't about perfect reality; they're about getting super close. And mine? It turned out pretty darn cute! Next up, I brought this baby into Spark Studio (yep, that's from Meta - the folks behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp). I told it to cook up thousands of these snowflakes and scatter them all over my virtual space. Then came the snowfall part. But they were all dropping at the same speed – kinda meh, right? Enter the noise algorithm: it mixed up their speed, position, and twirl in a nearly random way. Voilà, way better! It's not 100% real, but oh, it's a stunning effect. Noise algorithms aren’t just for this; they're behind cool stuff like Minecraft worlds and more. And guess what? There are loads of algorithms shaping your life – from finding the best train routes to maybe even suggesting this video to you!
