## Description

- Redundancy is a noun that means the state of being not or no longer needed or useful, or the inclusion of extra components which are not strictly necessary to functioning, in case of failure in other components.
- Redundancy can be avoided in writing by using concise and precise language, and avoiding unnecessary repetition or wordiness.
- Redundancy can be beneficial in some situations, such as in engineering or computing, where having backup systems or data can increase reliability and safety.

### Explaining redundancy with subtitles and webservers

#### Draft

The subtitles that you are reading is a redundancy. What is redundancy? Redundancy, in general, refers to the existence of something that is not strictly necessary but serves as backup or support.
For this video, it is not necessary to have subtitles as I am already talking. But if you don't have audio, you are glad that they are there so you can follow the video. It is also beneficial for people who can't hear.
Let's look at a more technical example of redundancy in the world of information technology.
If we think about the internet and opening for example a social network, many different people access this website. For this case, it makes sense that not all people access the same webserver where the site is hosted. Instead, we have multiple servers that have the same functionality and are therefore redundant.
In front of these servers, we then place something called a load balancer which can balance the load of all users of the social network. This also helps that all servers have about the same load and no server is overwhelmed which ensures availability and reliability.
If some of these servers fail, the social network will still work as other servers can take over, so no service disruptions occur.
Now you know that redundancy is very helpful in information technology and why (video starts over again so we have a loop)

#### Refined version with ChatGPT

**Introduction:**

Text: "Did you know? The subtitles you're reading right now are an example of redundancy."
Action: Stefan reading this line and pointing down at the subtitles

Text: "But what exactly is redundancy? In simple terms, redundancy means having something extra that isn't absolutely necessary, but it's there to provide backup or support."
Action: Stefan explaining this

**Example 1 - Subtitles:**

Text: "In this video, subtitles aren't essential since I'm speaking."
Action: Stefan explaining it while pointing at his mouth.

Text: "However, they're invaluable if you can't hear the audio or if you have hearing difficulties. This extra feature ensures everyone can follow along, no matter their situation."
Action: Split screen with one person watching the video but unable to hear it and the other person being comfortable by reading subtitles.

**Transition to Technical Example:**
"Now, let's dive into a more technical side of redundancy, specifically in the realm of information technology."

**Example 2 - IT and Web Servers:**
"Imagine you're accessing a social network on the internet. It's not just you; millions are doing the same. To manage this, instead of relying on a single webserver, the network uses multiple servers with identical functions. This is where IT redundancy comes into play."

**Elaboration on Load Balancers:**
"In front of these servers, we use a tool called a 'load balancer.' It directs user requests across all servers evenly. This not only prevents any one server from being overloaded but also ensures that if a server fails, the network keeps running smoothly."

**Conclusion and Seamless Loop into Introduction:**
"If some servers crash, others step in, making sure you can continue to doom scroll in your social media feed. This is the beauty of redundancy in IT - it's all about continuous service and reliability. Just like these subtitles, redundancy might not always seem essential, but it's always there, ensuring everything works seamlessly. Buut.."
