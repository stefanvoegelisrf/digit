Ever noticed in how many ways your face can move? Letâ€™s dive into the fascinating world of facial expressions. Have a look at these Movies, I'm sure you know at least one of them. They all contain some sort of facial animations that have been made by "Medusa". This is a Facial Capture System developed by Disney Research Studios. It uses some cameras and lights and with the power of software it can deliver digital copies of a face without needing to stick points onto your face. This system is quite complex and is based on years of research but one essential part of the underlying technology is the Facial Action Coding System, or short FACS. With FACS, individual muscle movements in the face are put into so called Action Units. I won't annoy you with the Latin terms, but Action Unit 45 is used for blinking which involves relaxing and contracting the related muscles. There are other action units like 54, which refer to moving your head down. To describe emotions, we can combine these action units and can express emotions like happiness, where we combine action units 6 and 12.
Now this is handy for capturing an actors performance and putting it onto a digital character, but as I already mentioned, there is a lot more going into that like analyzing the shininess and pores of the skin. I'm stunned what is possible today with capturing facial expressions and hey, here's another fun fact: The facial action coding system has also been used in studies to analyze the effects of Botox treatments on emotional expression. Results found that botox treatment of laughter lines was associated with increased depression scores. Further, botox treatment was associated with reduced emotion recognition ability and sexual function. So yeah, had to cancel an appointment today, but at least I have filters that can fill my wrinkles and lips.
