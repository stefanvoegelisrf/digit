## Discretization

Discretization describes the process to of processing signals and bringing it into some form of encoding.
E.g. a photo can be shot and to save it, it can be encoded as a jpeg. Through this process, there is always some information lost. This is due to the fact that we need to define a resolution that the image has e.g. 1920x1080. This will result in 2073600 pixels. So we can only store that amount of pixels and when zooming into the image, the individual pixels will become visible.
The same also applies to other encoding/formats.
