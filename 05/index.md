## Non-rivalry, non-exclusivity and non-exploitability

The terms "non-rivalry," "non-exclusivity," and "non-exploitability" are often used in the context of discussing the characteristics of public goods and intellectual property. Here is how they are related to each other and how they differ:

### Non-Rivalry
Non-rivalry describes a situation where the consumption of a good by one individual does not reduce the availability of that good for consumption by others. In other words, one person's use of the good does not interfere with another person’s ability to use the same good.

**Examples**:
- **Broadcast Television**: When one person watches a television program, it does not prevent others from watching the same program.
- **Public Park**: Individuals can enjoy the park at the same time without diminishing its value to each other.

#### Blocking Non-Rivalry
Non-rivalrous goods are those that can be consumed by one user without reducing their availability to others. To block this:

- **Limit Accessibility**: Introduce limitations on how many people can use the good at one time.
- **Create Scarcity**: Make the resource scarce, ensuring that its consumption by one user reduces its availability to others.
  
**Example**: Transforming an online course from an open-access model to a limited-enrollment model, where only a specific number of students can enroll at a time.

### Non-Exclusivity:
Non-exclusivity refers to the inability to exclude individuals from accessing or using a good, even if they do not pay for it. This is often a characteristic of public goods.

**Examples**:
- **Street Lighting**: It illuminates the street for everyone, regardless of whether they have contributed to its maintenance.
- **National Defense**: A country’s military protects all citizens, regardless of individual contribution to the defense budget.

#### Blocking Non-Exclusivity

Non-exclusive goods are available to everyone, regardless of their contribution to its maintenance or production. To block this:

- **Implement Paywalls or Subscription Services**: Ensure that only those who pay can access the good or service.
- **Require Membership or Authentication**: Implement a system where only members or authenticated users can access the service.
  
**Example**: Changing a public park into a private recreational facility that requires a membership for entry.

### Non-Exploitability
This term is less commonly used in economic contexts and doesn't have a standard definition. However, it could be interpreted as a situation where a good or resource cannot be exploited for individual gain at the expense of others or the public at large. It implies a protection against misuse or overuse of a resource.

**Examples**:  
- **Open Source Software**: While this software is non-rivalrous and non-exclusive, non-exploitability would mean that individuals or companies cannot take the software, modify it, and then sell it as their own proprietary product without adhering to the original licensing agreements.
- **Endangered Species Protection**: Laws that protect endangered species could be seen as enforcing non-exploitability, as they prevent individuals or companies from exploiting these animals for personal or commercial gain.

### Blocking Non-Exploitability

To ensure that a good can be exploited for personal gain, one could:

- **Loosen Regulations**: Reduce the legal and ethical protections that prevent exploitation.
- **Encourage Commercial Use**: Promote the commercial use of the resource, even at the expense of the public good or sustainability.
  
**Example**: Changing open source software licensing to a more permissive license that allows for proprietary use of the modified software.

### Differences and Relationships:

- **Non-Rivalry vs Non-Exclusivity**: A good can be non-rivalrous but not non-exclusive. For example, a subscription-based online streaming service is non-rivalrous (one person’s viewing doesn’t prevent others from watching), but it is exclusive (only subscribers can access the content). Public goods are both non-rivalrous and non-exclusive.
  
- **Non-Exploitability**: This term adds an additional layer, focusing on the ethical or legal dimensions of resource use. It is related to the idea of sustainability and responsible use of resources, ensuring that goods are available for future generations and not used in harmful or unfair ways.

Understanding these concepts is crucial in policy-making, economics, and law, especially when determining how goods should be provided and paid for, and how to protect common resources and intellectual property.

To "block" the characteristics of non-rivalry, non-exclusivity, and non-exploitability means to impose conditions or structures that prevent these features from being present in a good or service. Here’s how each can be counteracted:

## Relationship and Differences between Data Possession and Data Ownership:

**Data Possession**:  
- This refers to having physical or logical control over data. 
- A person or entity with data possession might have the ability to access, manipulate, and manage the data. 
- However, possession does not necessarily imply ownership or the right to control how the data is used or distributed.

**Data Ownership**:  
- This refers to having legal rights and control over a dataset.
- The owner of the data has the authority to decide how the data is used, shared, and distributed, and they bear the responsibility for its accuracy, integrity, and security.
- Ownership implies a level of power and control that goes beyond mere possession.

**Differences**: 
- Possession is about control and access, while ownership is about legal rights and responsibilities.
- A person or entity can possess data without owning it (e.g., a cloud service provider), and it’s also possible to own data without possessing it (e.g., if the data is stored by a third party).

---

### Example 1: Cloud Storage

**Scenario**: A company stores its customer data on a cloud storage service.

**Data Possession**:  
- The cloud storage provider has possession of the data. They maintain the servers where the data is stored, and they control access to those servers.
- However, they do not have the right to use or distribute the customer data for their own purposes.

**Data Ownership**:  
- The company remains the owner of the customer data. They have the right to decide how the data is used, who has access to it, and they bear the responsibility for its accuracy and privacy.
- Even though they do not possess the data directly, their ownership rights give them control over it.

---

### Example 2: Social Media

**Scenario**: An individual uploads photos to a social media platform.

**Data Possession**:  
- The social media platform has possession of the photos. They store the photos on their servers, and they control access to those photos.
- They might also have the ability to manipulate the photos, for example, to compress them or change their format.

**Data Ownership**:  
- The individual who took the photos is the owner of the photos. They have the right to use, distribute, and delete the photos.
- However, the terms of service of the social media platform might grant the platform certain rights to use the photos, showcasing the importance of understanding the legal implications of data ownership and usage agreements.

---

In summary, data possession is about control and access, while data ownership is about legal rights and responsibilities. Understanding the distinction is crucial in various contexts, including cloud computing, data management, and digital content creation.


## Processing degree of data

### Degree of Data Processing:
This refers to the extent to which data has been manipulated or transformed from its original state. It can range from raw, unprocessed data to highly processed and analyzed data.

### Raw Data:
This is data in its most original form, as it has been collected from the source, without any processing or manipulation. It may be messy, incomplete, and hard to analyze in this state.

### Processed Data:
This is data that has undergone some form of processing to make it more usable or to extract information. This can include cleaning, structuring, and transforming the data.

### Cleaned Data:
This is data that has been cleaned to remove inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and errors. Cleaning is a crucial part of data processing, especially when dealing with large datasets.

### Processed Data (Expanded Definition):
Processed data can also refer to data that has been transformed or manipulated for a specific purpose, such as analysis or visualization. This can include aggregation, normalization, or other transformations.

### Derived Data:
This is data that has been created or calculated based on other data. For example, calculating the average of a set of numbers creates derived data.

### Secondary Data:
This is data that was not originally collected for the current research purpose but is being reused. It can be raw, processed, or derived, depending on its state when acquired.

### Hyper Data:
This term is less common, but it could refer to data about data (metadata), or data that has been enriched or linked with additional context to provide a deeper level of understanding or analysis.

---

### Example 1: Weather Forecasting

**Raw Data:** Direct readings from weather stations, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

**Cleaned Data:** Removing any erroneous readings, correcting any inconsistencies (e.g., units of measurement).

**Processed Data:** Aggregating data from multiple weather stations, interpolating missing values, converting units if necessary.

**Derived Data:** Calculating the average temperature for a specific region, or predicting future weather conditions based on historical patterns.

**Secondary Data:** Using past weather data initially collected for climate research to predict future weather patterns.

---

### Example 2: Customer Feedback Analysis

**Raw Data:** Customer reviews and ratings from a website.

**Cleaned Data:** Removing any spam reviews, correcting typos, and standardizing the format.

**Processed Data:** Analyzing the sentiment of the reviews, categorizing them by topic, and extracting key themes.

**Derived Data:** Calculating the overall customer satisfaction score, or identifying trends in customer feedback over time.

**Secondary Data:** Using customer feedback data initially collected for service improvement to inform product development decisions.

**Hyper Data:** Data about the customer feedback, such as the date and time of submission, the user’s device type, or the geographic location of the submission, which can provide additional context and insights.

---

In summary, these terms are all interrelated and represent different stages and types of data within the data processing pipeline. The degree of data processing increases as you move from raw to processed to derived data, and understanding these stages is crucial for effective data analysis and decision-making.
